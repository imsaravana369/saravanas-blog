A static site generated with Hugo

I'm building this personal website using a predefined theme called [anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/anatole/), I also forked the repository to customize it to my need.

It's still a work in progress, trying to make one step at a time. Feeling really excited. Hugo is cool.

It's how its looking now
