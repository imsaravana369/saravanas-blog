## Test
I always have had a nagging feeling while writing if-else condition, it wasnâ€™t until I came across the term â€˜anti-if campaignâ€™ that I understood why.


Now, as a member of the anti-if campaign, allow me to persuade you why itâ€™s worth joining as well. (disclaimer at the endðŸ˜‚)

## Code Example
{{< highlight python >}}
def sign_mult(a, b):
    if (a == '+' and b == '+'):
        return '+'
    elif (a == '-' and b == '-'):
        return '+'
    elif (a == '+' and b == '-'):
        return '-'
    elif (a == '-' and b == '+'):
        return '-'
{{< / highlight >}}
