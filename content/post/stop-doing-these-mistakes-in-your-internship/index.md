Internship from a company especially from a dream one is the dream of every college student as it might end you up in a full-time job in that company or at least you can get a breeze of how it's like being a part of it.

When you are trying to get a full-time job by doing an internship, you need to prepare yourself for some worst-case scenarios. You can be very strong in your domain, you may think you have more knowledge(or indeed have that) than the employees, you may have worked on many projects, done many internships before, You may be very confident, you may have a great plan but life too has its own plan, maybe a different one. That‚Äôs what happened to me.

My Internship Story
===================

After going through many rigorous filtration processes, I got an internship offer that had all the potential to get me a full-time job offer. I was on cloud nine, not because I‚Äôd got the internship but because I was sure, dead sure, that I would also get the job offer until I had the first meeting with my mentor. On my second meeting, I lost all hope. On my third meeting with her, I‚Äôm firedüôÇ. I haven‚Äôt done anything, or asked to do anything, except reading and presenting about one of the company‚Äôs top-notch products to my mentor through their video meeting app.

I‚Äôm here to tell you what are the mistakes that I‚Äôve done or the things I‚Äôve failed to do, which cost me my dream job.

1.Not Understanding your Mentor
-------------------------------

You may think you will get a mentor like _Albus Dumbledore_ who will care for you, guide you, teach you some special spells but there‚Äôs a high chance, quite high, that your‚Äôs will be a _Severus Snape_.

We can‚Äôt blame them, the management may not have allocated a dedicated timing for your mentor to handle you. He got to do his work as well as mentoring you. Some mentors do that with passion but you can‚Äôt expect that from all. There‚Äôs a high probability that he considers mentoring as a burden that will not add even a single penny to his bank account. They are what they are you can‚Äôt change them but we can understand them and act accordingly.

I‚Äôm not telling you to read his mind, at least try to understand what he actually wants, what is he expecting from you. Is he getting frustrated if you do the same mistake again? so Stop repeating the same mistakes that you‚Äôve done before. If your mentor is not answering your questions, stopping asking him, ask Google. If your mentor doesn‚Äôt attend your call, most of the time. Don‚Äôt call him, message him.

**2.Speaking Unconsciously (Every word matters)**
-------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind, you are being judged by your mentor, every second. He is even monitoring the words you use in a casual conversation. I‚Äòve said _‚ÄúI‚Äôm not from this domain‚Äù quite a few times_. My mentor told me specifically this as the reason to fire me from the internship. Those are the words I said unconsciously she even noticed that.

**3.Not Doing menial tasks sincerely (Every task matters)**
-----------------------------------------------------------

To be honest, I haven‚Äôt sincerely done all the small tasks my mentor had given me. I thought they are boring and did them with no sincerity. She specifically told this as another reason for firing me _‚ÄúYou were not sincerely doing those small tasks I‚Äôve assigned you‚Äù_ So please do every job that is given to you with at most sincerity and dedication. It might sound silly but every tasks matter.

4.Being in your comfort zone
----------------------------

This is to all the tech people out there. You might have thought that software development is all about coding, at least I have thought like that, but that's not the case. **_You are also going to study some other domains_**, mostly the domain of the product you are going to build.

I was put under the finance department which builds software for accounting, payroll management, etc. I was terrified to learn all the new so-called _financial jargon_, I was asking my friends, my relatives who have studied finance as their major but I wanted to code, to code only. I wanted to show how skillful I‚Äôm in my domain instead of completely embracing the fact that I need to learn something out of my comfort zone. I resisted the change so I‚Äôm laid off. So Please consider everything as a learning opportunity instead of sticking to what you already know.

Some things are out of our control
----------------------------------

Mentors are meant to guide us through our internship sometimes we may get a mentor who guides us **out of the internship.** They may not answer your question, they may demotivate you better than your relatives, sometimes even make you question yourself, _am I that bad?_ No, you‚Äôre not.
