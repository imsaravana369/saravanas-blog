<section name="a254" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="6121" id="6121" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">Stop doing these mistakes in your Internship</h3><p name="8977" id="8977" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Internship from a company especially from a dream one is the dream of every college student as it might end you up in a full-time job in that company or at least you can get a breeze of how it&#39;s like being a part of it.</p><p name="d310" id="d310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you are trying to get a full-time job by doing an internship, you need to prepare yourself for some worst-case scenarios. You can be very strong in your domain, you may think you have more knowledge(or indeed have that) than the employees, you may have worked on many projects, done many internships before, You may be very confident, you may have a great plan but life too has its own plan, maybe a different one. That‚Äôs what happened to me.</p><figure name="1767" id="1767" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*nYP1NbHPdw0aAK5CRnVHLQ.jpeg" data-width="640" data-height="437" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nYP1NbHPdw0aAK5CRnVHLQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Image source: <a href="https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/" data-href="https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com</a></figcaption></figure><h3 name="f151" id="f151" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">My Internship Story</h3><p name="45c9" id="45c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After going through many rigorous filtration processes, I got an internship offer that had all the potential to get me a full-time job offer. I was on cloud nine, not because I‚Äôd got the internship but because I was sure, dead sure, that I would also get the job offer until I had the first meeting with my mentor. On my second meeting, I lost all hope. On my third meeting with her, I‚Äôm firedüôÇ. I haven‚Äôt done anything, or asked to do anything, except reading and presenting about one of the company‚Äôs top-notch products to my mentor through their video meeting app.</p><p name="428d" id="428d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I‚Äôm here to tell you what are the mistakes that I‚Äôve done or the things I‚Äôve failed to do, which cost me my dream job.</p><h4 name="81d2" id="81d2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">1.Not Understanding your¬†Mentor</h4><p name="e740" id="e740" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You may think you will get a mentor like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Albus Dumbledore </em>who will care for you, guide you, teach you some special spells but there‚Äôs a high chance, quite high, that your‚Äôs will be a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Severus Snape</em>.</p><p name="e348" id="e348" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can‚Äôt blame them, the management may not have allocated a dedicated timing for your mentor to handle you. He got to do his work as well as mentoring you. Some mentors do that with passion but you can‚Äôt expect that from all. There‚Äôs a high probability that he considers mentoring as a burden that will not add even a single penny to his bank account. They are what they are you can‚Äôt change them but we can understand them and act accordingly.</p><p name="2e12" id="2e12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I‚Äôm not telling you to read his mind, at least try to understand what he actually wants, what is he expecting from you. Is he getting frustrated if you do the same mistake again? so Stop repeating the same mistakes that you‚Äôve done before. If your mentor is not answering your questions, stopping asking him, ask Google. If your mentor doesn‚Äôt attend your call, most of the time. Don‚Äôt call him, message him.</p><h4 name="73d4" id="73d4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">2.Speaking Unconsciously (Every word¬†matters)</strong></h4><p name="b127" id="b127" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Keep in mind, you are being judged by your mentor, every second. He is even monitoring the words you use in a casual conversation. I‚Äòve said <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not from this domain‚Äù quite a few times</em>. My mentor told me specifically this as the reason to fire me from the internship. Those are the words I said unconsciously she even noticed that.</p><h4 name="a542" id="a542" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">3.Not Doing menial tasks sincerely (Every task¬†matters)</strong></h4><p name="4484" id="4484" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To be honest, I haven‚Äôt sincerely done all the small tasks my mentor had given me. I thought they are boring and did them with no sincerity. She specifically told this as another reason for firing me <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‚ÄúYou were not sincerely doing those small tasks I‚Äôve assigned you‚Äù </em>So please do every job that is given to you with at most sincerity and dedication. It might sound silly but every tasks matter.</p><h4 name="1bbc" id="1bbc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">4.Being in your comfort¬†zone</h4><p name="61fc" id="61fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is to all the tech people out there. You might have thought that software development is all about coding, at least I have thought like that, but that&#39;s not the case. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">You are also going to study some other domains</em></strong>, mostly the domain of the product you are going to build.</p><p name="7e10" id="7e10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was put under the finance department which builds software for accounting, payroll management, etc. I was terrified to learn all the new so-called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">financial jargon</em>, I was asking my friends, my relatives who have studied finance as their major but I wanted to code, to code only. I wanted to show how skillful I‚Äôm in my domain instead of completely embracing the fact that I need to learn something out of my comfort zone. I resisted the change so I‚Äôm laid off. So Please consider everything as a learning opportunity instead of sticking to what you already know.</p><h4 name="76c2" id="76c2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Some things are out of our¬†control</h4><p name="0c79" id="0c79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Mentors are meant to guide us through our internship sometimes we may get a mentor who guides us <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">out of the internship. </strong>They may not answer your question, they may demotivate you better than your relatives, sometimes even make you question yourself, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">am I that bad? </em>No, you‚Äôre not.</p><p name="b79e" id="b79e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">There are certain aspects of life you have no control over. I‚Äôd never thought I would get such a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">great mentor</em> who would throw me out of the internship within a week without even evaluating what I knew. Stuff like this happens, but try to be positive and analyze where did it all go wrong, learn and grow from your mistakes. Yes I know it‚Äôs your dream company, but let it go and say to yourself <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‚ÄúGod has a better plan for me‚Äù </em>That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve told myself.</p></div></div></section>
